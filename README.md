# Ticket Checkout

## How I worked on this project
- I used a prompt given by a take-home assessment and followed the directions given by it: [Screenshot of prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22102599/232319188-9ac34d32-f793-43dd-b794-a7f23dfe91f5.png)
- I used feature branches and made PR requests on master: [Example PR](https://github.com/devkdn/ticket-checkout/pull/5)
- I planned out my design using the criteria in the design prompt. I followed the written acceptance criteria and took inspiration from the visual reference provided.
